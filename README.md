Fintoc on Rails

Template for new devs that want to work with Ruby over Fintoc can easily plug and play, avoiding docs frustration.

## Why?

You can think of Fintoc API docs as a hot piscola. And the key ingredient to a properly made piscola are the ice cubes, because no one wants to drink a hot piscola. Sure, you can still have a hot piscola and spend a horrible time. But hey… that’s not enjoyable -- why would you do that? Do yourself a favor: go grab some ice cubes by using this template.
